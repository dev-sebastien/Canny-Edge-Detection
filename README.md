# Canny Edge Detection

This repo walks through the step-by-step implementation of the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.

You'll find:
- Explanation and code for each step of the algorithm  
- Visual outputs at every stage  
- A full script that puts everything together  
- A comparison between my implementation and OpenCV's built-in Canny function
